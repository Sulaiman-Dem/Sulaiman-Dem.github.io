## About me

I’m a Computer Science graduate with a strong passion for solving real-world problems through technology, especially where data plays a central role. With hands-on experience in both advanced manufacturing and applied data science, I bring a unique combination of technical precision, analytical thinking, and adaptability to the table.

At NXP Semiconductors, I currently work as a Machine Operator through Randstad, where I’ve developed a deep understanding of high-precision environments. I monitor live tool performance, troubleshoot real-time errors, and collaborate with engineering teams to maintain optimal output. My work here has sharpened my skills in system analysis, documentation, and cross-functional communication—all vital in any tech-driven role.

In parallel, I completed the highly respected CUNY Tech Prep Data Science Fellowship, where I gained practical experience with Python, SQL, machine learning, data visualisation, and cloud-based collaboration tools. My capstone project, Deepfake Hunter, involved building a TensorFlow model capable of detecting synthetic audio from over 200,000 samples. I built automated data pipelines with Librosa, deployed a user-facing interface with Streamlit, and trained the model using Google Colab Pro. This project taught me not only how to apply machine learning concepts but also how to deploy them in a way that’s accessible and intuitive for end users.

My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, TensorFlow, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks, Streamlit, and Git/GitHub, and I’m always learning new tools and techniques to improve my craft. Whether it’s building data pipelines, writing clean code, analysing system behaviour, or collaborating with teams to deliver quality results, I take pride in being resourceful, self-motivated, and impact-driven.

I’m currently seeking a full-time role in tech that allows me to work on data-centric problems, whether in AI/ML, analytics, back-end development, or technical support. I’m particularly interested in roles where I can contribute to meaningful projects—ideally in industries such as health tech, clean tech, AI safety, or automation—but I’m open to any opportunity that challenges me to grow and solve problems using data and logic.
