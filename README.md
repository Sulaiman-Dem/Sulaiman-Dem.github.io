## About me

What sets me apart as a programmer is my ability to break down complex systems and code into simple, understandable terms for diverse audiences. As a U.S. citizen authorized to work in the United States, I am eager to contribute my skills and passion for technology to your team.

I am a graduate of CUNY York College seeking a full-time role in AI, machine learning, or related fields such as SQL development, or data analysis. Technology is constantly evolving, and I thrive in environments where continuous learning and innovation are encouraged. Every project I undertake provides a unique opportunity to expand my expertise and contribute to advancements in the field.

My long-term goal is to work in AI and robotics, collaborating with a team to explore how these technologies can enhance everyday lifeâ€”particularly in fitness and health, areas that are personally important to me. I am excited about the potential of AI-driven solutions to promote healthier lifestyles and improve overall well-being.

I look forward to bringing my technical skills, problem-solving mindset, and enthusiasm for innovation to a forward-thinking organization.
