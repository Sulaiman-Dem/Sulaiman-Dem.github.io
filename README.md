## About me

I am a CUNY York College graduate looking for a full-time job in data science/AI/Machine learning or similar fields. Since, the future is all about technology, and no one can deny that. We, humans, can only progress as a race when we advance our knowledge of our surroundings, but the only way to make that easier is to use technology. This is why I am interested in joining the AI enhancement because it is something that is always a learning experience. Every new project you do or finish provides you with a unique experience that improves your knowledge further for future innovations. What separates me from other programmers is the ability to take a complex system/code and explain it in terms that everyone can understand, which most programmers with many years of experience lack. If I know how to use the tools I can teach them to others.

I finished doing a data science fellowship at CUNY Tech Prep to get more experience in analysis and big data so I can work with AI.

Eventually, I want to get a job in data science/AI/machine learning and work with a team to face the question of how could we leverage AI into our everyday lives.
